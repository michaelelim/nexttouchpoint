PRESTO

I hope you are doing well!

As the new month is approaching, I wanted to plan ahead and ask if you require a Presto pass for next month?
This allows me time to put in the request early and hopefully expedite the approval.

As always, please note that the funding is meant to be temporary until you've landed employment and gained some stability at the job.

Please let me know.
Thanks!

SICK RESCHEDULE

Good morning,
